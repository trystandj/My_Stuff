### Example:
 Dear Jim
 
 I attended the site of 21 Union Street today. **(SITUATION)**
 I noticed parts of the roof are already showing damage because the correct insulation material has not been used. **(COMPLICATION)**
 We need to replace the current materials with those we recommended in our original plans, which I’ve attached. **(RESOLUTION)**
 In the meantime, please halt work on the building immediately until we can take steps to conduct the work properly. **(ACTION)**
 If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me on 020 5678 910. **(POLITENESS)**
 
 Best wishes
 Dan
