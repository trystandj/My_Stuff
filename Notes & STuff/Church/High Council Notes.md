## Braydon 
- What is conversion
- How does conversion happen
- How do we participate in it
Alma 22 about king lamoni - when someone converts they ask how do I do this? How do I receive these blessings? They understand the blessings that come and want to change. If they truly understand they would do everything to follow Christ.

Don't let the mission and your life be different, they are only different if you make it. Still be the person you were, you don't have to change. 


## Welcome to the church of Joy

When was the greatest joyful moment you have ever had? 
Joy helps us feel the spirit. It comes from Christ and is a gift to us. Our joy should be apparent when we gather together. We have the tools to become the happiest people here on earth. How can we turn our meetings into more joyous moments? How can we make it more intentional? How about our facial expressions and actions on the stands? Do we reflect joy to the ward? How about singing? Do we sing with joy or with mumbling? Are we getting distracted during the sacrament? It should be a moment to reflect but not get stuck in the pass. We should focus on the progress we can make that is possible because of the atonement of Christ.
