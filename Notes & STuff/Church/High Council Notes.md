### Check the handbook before anything!!!

##### Extending a Calling
- Should be a meaningful spiritual experience for a member
- not in a casual manner
- Sit down with them, pray with them. Talk with them 
- Understand if there circumstances will allow him or her to serve. 
- If needed you can give people time to think about it
- Pray about it and help them understand that it comes from the lord
- Figure out what the calling is so you can explain it and help answer any questions they may have
- The Lord is calling you to be, this was received by revelation and confirmed by multiple people 
- Can invite their spouses                                                                                            
###### Releasing members from callings
- Meet with them before
- May invite them to share what they learned
- help make it a spiritual moment 


### Brother Snyder returned Missionary
- Came to love the Savior, and it changed him
- The church is real, mission was a foundation to him
- Scripture study was a big thing that helped him know that it is true and by testifying 
- Book of Mormon is true and an amazing book 
- He LIVES!  


### Revelation

- Everyday we should seek to follow the promptings we receive, we should be open and seek to find those promptings
- Good inspiration is based upon good information - Pres Russel m Nelson 
- We can pray to God to ask for promptings for guidance
- Then we should seek to understand and discern the spirit 

#### Pres Worthington
- We need to live close to the spirit
- Daily Repentance with sincerity! 
- So we can live closer to the spirit and that we can become a greater tool
- Take time to recognize the moments the lord has extended his hand in our days
- Write down promptings, thoughts, feelings! Write down
- Revelations through Gratitude 


# TO DO
- Mosiah Chapter 26 Study the chapter and think about it
- Think about how it ties into the Prophets talk about revelation 
- Don't be afraid to help out people "simply"

## Braydon 
- What is conversion
- How does conversion happen
- How do we participate in it
Alma 22 about king lamoni - when someone converts they ask how do I do this? How do I receive these blessings? They understand the blessings that come and want to change. If they truly understand they would do everything to follow Christ.

Don't let the mission and your life be different, they are only different if you make it. Still be the person you were, you don't have to change. 


## Welcome to the church of Joy

When was the greatest joyful moment you have ever had? 
Joy helps us feel the spirit. It comes from Christ and is a gift to us. Our joy should be apparent when we gather together. We have the tools to become the happiest people here on earth. How can we turn our meetings into more joyous moments? How can we make it more intentional? How about our facial expressions and actions on the stands? Do we reflect joy to the ward? How about singing? Do we sing with joy or with mumbling? Are we getting distracted during the sacrament? It should be a moment to reflect but not get stuck in the pass. We should focus on the progress we can make that is possible because of the atonement of Christ.
