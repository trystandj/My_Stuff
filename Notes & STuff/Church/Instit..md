Nos sabemos o bem e mal
A lei ta dado ao nos
Pela lei, nenhum carne ta justficada 
Pela graca do senhor sobre tudo que nos podemos fazer que estamos salvados

We can't get in the perspective that its harder to hear the promptings of the spirit after our mission. As we compare ourselves to our past selfs of the mission. 
We must have confidence in the Lord. We have to seek him every day and rely upon him every day.  We can't do this alone. We need more then ourselves, we need a savior.

Something magical happens when we let the Lord work in our lives through faith and repentance

We have to have faith in repentance, faith that we can be forgiven and to forgive ourselves. Sometimes we have to walk a bit without knowing whats going to happen, like we are blind. It is by grace after all that we do can we be saved

We always have access to his atonement, in every moment, in everyplace, anywhere we are in life
Its difficult, but its necessary and its worth it
He is the way, if he is first in our lives, its worth it. Everything will work in this world and the next if he is first in our lives. 
You can never go wrong if you choose what is right. He is the way. 

Invite: show the Lord that you want to place him first in your life. Every week, reach out to someone from your mission and spend some time talking with them. At least 15 minutes.

Grant and continued in that position throughout a long and eventful life” ([“Faith, the Greater Knowledge,”](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/1978/08/faith-the-greater-knowledge?lang=eng&id=p3-p26,p29#p3) New Era, Aug. 1978, 4–6).
