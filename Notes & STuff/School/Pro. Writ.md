Language is a tool we use to give and seek information. 
	**Rhetoric** "the act of speaking a language"
		and expanded its importance to include how language was used for a persuasive purpose, to motivate and audience to action. 

# Audience
	Everything you write should be done iwth your reader in mind. It is important to craft your message to achieve the desired response from your specific readers

**Research** what you know about your audience. Consider all their aspects. Find out what they already know about your topic and then build your writing from their. 

# Purpose
	After you know your audience, defire your purpose in writing your message. Do you want to persuade or motivate others to take actio? what do you want them to do? Keep that in mind while writing. Without purpose, your writing is trash. 


# Channel 
	Once you know your audience and your purupose, you can identify which writing strategies you should use to accomplish your writing goals. Will the audience respond best to emotins or logic? How can you craft your message to effectively accomplish your goals? Think about the reaction you want the readers to have when they read your writing. Do you want them to change their behavior? Is the goal to educate them? To get an emotinal reaction? 



# Strategies of Persuasion
	Communicative situations often contain rhetoric, which is the craft of persuading through writing or speaking. You likely have used rhetoric to be persuasive and to recognize when others are trying to persuade you.

## Ethos
- Ethos is the presentation of a believable, authoritative voice that elicits an audience’s trust. In the case of the clean water example, you might mention your expertise in studying the problems unclean water can cause, so your reader knows you are an expert and should listen to you.

## Pathos
- Pathos appeals to feelings and emotions shared by an audience. Adding to our example of clean water, you could mention that parents who love their children and want them to have a healthy future will fight for their family’s right to pure drinking water.

## Logos
- Logos is the use of credible information—facts, reasons, examples—that moves toward a sensible and acceptable conclusion. As you write to persuade people about the importance of clean water, you can share facts about how small changes by the local leaders will improve water sources.

## Kairos
- Kairos is a fourth and lesser known rhetorical appeal, and is the idea that timing is important in trying to persuade an audience. An appeal may succeed or fail depending on when it is made. The moment must be right, and an effective communicator needs to be aware of their audience in terms of kairos. Imagine there is an increase in disease spread by contaminated water, which causes schools to be canceled, and this is the moment you write a piece to engage families about making changes to create local filtering systems so this never happens again.  Your audience might be more receptive to a proposal because of the timing.


## Literary Language

You can also use more subtle strategies with your choice of language and organization.   

- Figurative language: similes and metaphors. Comparing one aspect of two things that are otherwise completely different is an essential part of rhetorical language. Simile example: “The treasure chest of nature’s wonders shone like a pirate’s gold tooth.” Metaphor example: “The pizza was a disk of saucy sunlight.”
- Numerical data: statistics and figures. When accurate, numerical data can strengthen an argument.
- Parallel structure: repetition of the same pattern of words to show that ideas are equally significant. Parallel structure, or parallelism, calls attention to ideas, achieves balance, and makes statements more memorable. For example, United States President John F. Kennedy said, “Ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country.”
- Personification: giving an inanimate or nonhuman object human characteristics to make it seem alive and relatable. Examples: “The virus packed its bags and spread across the ocean” or “The internet erupted in outrage.”
- Repetition: repeating a single word or group of words to build emphasis. Example: “The first cause is poverty; the second cause is poor health; the third cause is discrimination. These causes have been studied, but to what effect?”
- Rhetorical question: one question that is not expected to be answered, one for which there is no answer, or one that creates a dramatic effect. Examples: “Has it occurred to you to ask why the economy is so unstable? A first point to consider is . . .”; “Do you think poverty will go away by itself?”
- Understatement: presenting something as less important than it is as a way of distancing from the truth. Understatement is often used sarcastically or ironically. Example: “It may not have occurred to politicians that poverty leads to a host of health-related issues.”



## Logical Fallacies

Some rhetorical strategies should be avoided as “sneakier” uses of flawed reasoning, also known as logical fallacies. These strategies undermine your logical argument. It may sound convincing, but the logical is flawed and may distract from the real issue.

- Ad hominem: attacking the person, not the argument. “Only the ignorant and cruel don’t stand up for clean water.”
-  Bandwagon: an argument that everyone is doing something, so you shouldn’t be left behind by not doing it too. “Everyone is going to vote for clean water.”
- Causal fallacy: claiming or implying that an event that follows another event is the result of it. “Your children won’t grow tall if we don’t clean our water sources soon.”
- Hyperbole: exaggeration. “If we do not value clean water, our lives are not worth living.”
- Slippery slope: argument that a single action could lead to disastrous consequences. “Drinking unclean water will always cause early, painful death.”




## Rhetorical Analysis
Now that you understand how to write using these tools, it is also important that you know how to see these tools used by other writers. This is a process known as rhetorical analysis


### The Workings of Rhetorical Analysis

The aim of rhetorical analysis is not to find agreement with or praise for the writer. You are looking for the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of the writing by identifying the writer’s tools and what they accomplish.




### Revising Stage 1: Seeing the Big Picture

When you first begin your revision process, you should focus on the big picture or issues at the essay level that might need to be addressed. The following questions will guide you:

- Do you have a clear thesis? Do you know what idea or perspective you want your reader to understand upon reading your essay?
- Is your essay well organized?
- Is each paragraph a building block in your essay: does each explain or support your thesis?
- Does it need a different shape? Do parts need to be moved?
- Do you fully explain and illustrate the main ideas of your paper?
- Does your introduction grab the reader’s interest?
- Does your conclusion leave the reader understanding your point of view?
- Are you saying in your essay what you want to say?
- What is the strength of your paper? What is its weakness?

### Revising Stage 2: Mid-View

The second stage of the revision process requires that you look at your content closely and at the paragraph level. It’s now time to examine each paragraph, on its own, to see where you might need to revise. The following questions will guide you through the mid-view revision stage:

- Does each paragraph contain solid, specific information, vivid descriptions, or examples that illustrate the point you are making in the paragraph?
- Are there other facts, quotations, examples, or descriptions to add that can more clearly illustrate or provide evidence for the points you are making?
- Are there sentences, words, descriptions, or information that you can delete because they don’t add to the points you are making or may confuse the reader?
- Are the paragraphs in the right order?
- Are your paragraphs overly long? Does each paragraph explore one main idea?
- Do you use clear transitions so the reader can follow your thinking?
- Are any paragraphs or parts of paragraphs redundant and do they need to be deleted?
-   
    

### Revising Stage 3: Editing Up Close

Once you have completed your revision and feel confident in your content, you’ll want to begin the editing stage of your revision and editing process, which we will elaborate on later.
